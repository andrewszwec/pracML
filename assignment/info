describe how you built the model
------------------------------------------
Purpose: to build an algorithm to predict acitivity quality from the activity monitors.


Procedure:
1. The file pml-training.csv was spit into a training set (70%) and a cross-validation set (30%).

2. These two data sets were cleaned up using the following methods then the new training set was used to train the random forest model and the cross-validation set was used to test the predictive power of this random forest model.

3. Methods for cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
	a) remove catagorical variables from dataset including "X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", "cvtd_timestamp", "new_window ", "num_window".
	b) Remove any features that have little variance or information value using nearZeroVar().
	c) Remove columns with NA values in them.
	d) Look at the correlation of the remaining attributes and decide whether they need to be reduced further.

How you used cross validation
------------------------------------------
I used cross-validation set (the 30% data held out from the training set) to check the models performance by comparing the predictions of the random forest model with the real classe values.

The accuracy of the random forest model is 100% on the cross valiation set.


What is the out of sample error rate
------------------------------------------
The out of sample error is:

out_of_sample_error <- 1/n sum( ( prediction - truth )^2 )

The out of sample error for the random forest is __
and the out of sample error for the regression model is __.

This shows that the random forest model more accurately models the likely out of classe that the regression model.




Assumptions and choices:
------------------------------------------


Git Hub must include:
- Rmd
- HTML compiled file



kniting from the commandline
-------------------------------
require(knitr) # required for knitting from rmd to md
require(markdown) # required for md to html 
knit('knitrTest.rmd', 'knitrTest.md') # creates md file
markdownToHTML('knitrTest.md', 'knitrTest.html') # creates html file
